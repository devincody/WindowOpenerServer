# WindowOpenerServer
ESP32-based webserver which communicates with google home to open my windows

This project is a continuation of my [raspitemp](https://github.com/devincody/raspitemp) temperature project which I undertook to reduce the temperature inside my house without needing to run the AC all the time. 


## Hardware
As per usual, any electrical engineering project in my house is not complete without a proper PCB.
